We provide some notes on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation in the `introduction.ipynb` notebook and two example scripts that showcase the main function of this package:

1. `livegen.jl`: Starts a stream of live sonification and heatmap plotting of the KS solution.

2. `export.jl`: From a given KS solution, an audio file, a static heatmap image and an animated heatmap video are generated and written to disk.
